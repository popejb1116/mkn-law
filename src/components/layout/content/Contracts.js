These contracts often include complex compensation arrangements, detailed performance expectations, and other unique terms and conditions with one goal in mind: to memorialize the business owner's goals and expectations, minimize risk, and maximize an employee's potential to accomplish employer expectations through the proper employment framework."
const text2 = "These type of employment contracts may include, for example, a highly complex commission compensation arrangement for an experienced doctor; a renewable for cause contract with a modified termination provision following an initial term for a board appointed executive director; a conditional ownership purchase option integrated into an employment contract for a business partner employee; an agreement of non-competition and non-solicitation for a current employee along with a release of prior claims; or an offer letter memorializing at-will employment with appropriate language to create a fixed-salary fluctuating workweek arrangement under federal wage and hour regulations."
const text3 = "Quite simply, my firm prepares, drafts, and reviews a wide variety of employment contracts with an eye towards attention to detail, creativity, and a strong grounding in contract law."
const text4 = "I also frequently review many of these same types of contracts for individual employees, including non-competition agreements, non-solicitation agreements, severance agreements, or standard employment contracts, in addition to the negotiation of these agreements with a positive approach to the new employment relationship."
